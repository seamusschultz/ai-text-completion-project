            "Enter your prompt, or type 'exit' to quit:  how does climate change affect the polar bear population?\n",
            "AI: Climate change has had a significant impact on the polar bear population, primarily through the loss and degradation of their habitat. Polar bears depend heavily on sea ice for hunting seals, their primary source of food. With rising global temperatures, sea ice extent and duration are declining, reducing the platform polar bears need to hunt and causing what is known as \"long fasts\" for the bears. This leads to increased energy stress, especially for female polar bears who need ample fat reserves for reproduction and lactation.\n",
            "\n",
            "The reduction in sea ice also forces polar bears to change their behavior. Some bears are spending more time on land, leading to increased human-bear interactions and potential conflicts. They may also have to switch to alternative food sources, such as berries, birds, and marine invertebrates, which are less nutritious and require more energy to hunt or gather. These dietary changes can further impact their health and reproductive success.\n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, climate change can indirectly affect polar bear populations by altering the distribution and abundance of their prey. Changes in temperature and ice conditions can affect the availability of seals, causing polar bears to travel further or alter their hunting strategies. The overall fitness and survival rates of polar bears are impacted by these changes, and their population decline is a significant concern for conservationists. Efforts to mitigate climate change and protect critical polar bear habitats are crucial for ensuring the long-term survival of this iconic species.\n",

            "Imagine you have a toy collection, and you want to group some of your toys together so they don't get lost. You can use a tuple, which is like a magical box, to put those toys inside. Once they're inside, you can't take them out or put more toys in; that box is now closed and keeps your toys safe.\n",
